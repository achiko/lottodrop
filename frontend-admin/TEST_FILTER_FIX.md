# Filter Input Focus Fix - Test Plan

## Problem Fixed
The filter inputs in the admin panel were losing focus when typing/deleting because the `filterFields` array was being recreated on every render due to dependencies on `searchTerm` and `statusFilter`.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Removed value properties** from filterFields - let FilterSection manage its own state
2. **Removed dependencies** from useMemo in filterFields to create stable references
3. **Empty dependency arrays** ensure filterFields are created only once

## Files Fixed
- ✅ `/frontend-admin/src/pages/Users.tsx` - Fixed (removed searchTerm, statusFilter dependencies)
- ✅ `/frontend-admin/src/pages/Rounds.tsx` - Fixed (removed searchTerm, statusFilter dependencies)  
- ✅ `/frontend-admin/src/pages/Rooms.tsx` - Already had empty dependency array

## Testing Instructions
1. Open Admin Panel at http://localhost:3002
2. Navigate to **Users** page
3. Click on the search input field
4. Type text slowly and use backspace/delete
5. **Verify**: Focus should remain in the input field
6. Test the same on **Rounds** and **Rooms** pages

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ Input focus persists while typing
- ✅ Input focus persists when using backspace/delete
- ✅ Filtering still works correctly
- ✅ Clear filters button still works
- ✅ Filter state is maintained properly

## Technical Details
The issue was caused by:
```javascript
// OLD - Causes re-render on every searchTerm/statusFilter change
const filterFields = useMemo(() => {
  // ... fields with value properties
}, [searchTerm, statusFilter]);

// NEW - Stable reference, no re-renders
const filterFields = useMemo(() => [
  // ... fields without value properties
], []); // Empty dependency array
```

The FilterSection component now manages its own internal state for text inputs with proper debouncing, preventing unnecessary re-renders while maintaining all functionality.
